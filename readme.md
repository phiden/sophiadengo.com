## This is built on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/)

I chose Eleventy because it's static and lightweight, which is all I need for a portfolio / personal site. Why overcomplicate things?

In 2022 I 'learned' 11ty using the [Learn 11ty from Scratch tutorial](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/lesson/2.html#hello-world), modifying in bits and pieces so that I could get online quickly.

So, the next time I have to come pick this up:

- update npm
- update node
- `npx eleventy --serve`
