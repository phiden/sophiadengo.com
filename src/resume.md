## Experience

### DemandStar Corporation: Product Designer
#### Feb 2021 - present
As the sole designer at the company, I’m responsible for modernizing the user experience of a product first designed in 1998, which includes establishing a new design system, conducting research with our user base and driving our integration of accessibility best practices, including the use of semantic HTML, screen-reader best practices, and plain-language usage. This requires developing and investing in quality working relationships with my colleagues across engineering, support, and sales, as well as with DemandStar’s CEO.

### Ad Hoc, LLC: Senior UX Designer - Front-end Specialist2017 - 2021
#### GSA Fleet: UI/UX Lead: Oct 2020 - Jan 2021
GSA Fleet is a brand-new program, responsible for modernizing vehicle fleet management software for the US government.

After being put forward as key personnel, and running the bid UX team, I began work as the UI/UX lead for GSA Fleet in October 2020. I run a team of five designers and researchers, who are responsible for defining the user experience for a brand-new, modern fleet management platform.

#### CMS EQRS: Senior Designer: Aug 2019 - Oct 2020
EQRS -- End-stage Renal Failure Quality Reporting System -- is an effort to modernize the three legacy systems that CMS uses to determine how clinicians are performing, with respect to rendering care to renal patients.

I rolled on to the project mid-stream to provide subject-matter expertise in human-centered design and research practices. As one of three designers, I ultimately led the redesign of a substantial chunk of the EQRS ecosystem: the Quality Incentive Program.

In an effort to standardize the user interface across EQRS, I also advocated for and eventually rebuilt the program's design system, with the intent of leaving it so that it might be picked up easily by another dev or designer.

#### CMS Quality Payment Program (QPP) & Website Development Support (WDS): Senior Designer: Aug 2018 - Aug 2019
Splitting time between QPP and WDS, I advocated for and supported a pair of design systems at different levels of maturity.

The QPP design system was only an idea when I began work, and I spent a fair amount of time auditing the UI and working with the development and design teams to bridge gaps in understanding and need. By the time I left, we had a prototype system in development.

The WDS design system, on the other hand, was already in active use when I joined the program. The work was to advocate for its use across CMS properties while simultaneously maturing the system itself. As a team of two, we focused on socializing the system to people unfamiliar with design systems as a concept, while also considering best practices for governance, growth, and component deprecation.

#### Vets.gov (now VA.gov): Senior Designer: Jan 2017 - Aug 2018
Working in concert with the Digital Service at VA, I helped to design and validate a variety of forms and services on Vets.gov, including a Discharge Upgrade tool that helped over 100,000 Veterans regain access to their benefits.

I also originated the design system, affectionately known as Formation, working directly with two engineers to get stakeholder buy-in and bring the system into production.

I was ultimately able to use the design system to support the Vets.gov/VA.gov brand consolidation, using it to rapidly code prototypes of the new VA.gov homepage.

### Independent Design and Development
#### 2007 - now
I provide freelance design and development skills to individuals, small businesses, and agencies.

Lately, I've been supporting a pair of Shopify websites for two women-owned small businesses with very different sets of needs.

Ellen Hoffman is a longstanding client of mine, a jeweler who at the end of 2019 decided to move off the Wordpress e-commerce platform I'd set up in 2015 to Shopify, looking to ease the back-end management of her business, Ellen Hoffman Designs.

When COVID hit, I heard from the owner of Pied Piper Kids, a 50-year-old brick and mortar children's store in Baltimore, MD. Facing the possibility of losing her business when the city shut down, she wanted to replace her decade-old webpage with a Shopify storefront. We were able to launch her store inside three weeks, and it remains online even as her brick-and-mortar has reopened.

One of my longest-running projects is BorderStories, an independently produced documentary series that launched in 2008 and remains online. In 2017, I pulled down the original, Flash-based site I'd built while traveling with the documentary team and replaced it with a much more lightweight site that houses the YouTube cut of the documentary.

### Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University: Analyst
#### 2016 - 2017
As part of Bloomberg Philanthropies’ What Works Cities initiative, spent 11 months doing on-site city government assessments, determining how cities collect and use civic data. Handled GovEx’s internal tech projects and provided feedback on external consultants’ design work.

### Code for America: Fellow
#### 2015
Worked with Miami-Dade County, applying best practices in user experience and modern software development to facilitate the way the government and its residents interact with one another.

### CNN.com: Senior news designer (‘11 - ‘13). Designer (‘08 - ‘11)
#### 2008 - 2013
Responsible for infographics, maps, charts, and long-form multimedia stories for CNN.com, including coverage of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and other major news events.
