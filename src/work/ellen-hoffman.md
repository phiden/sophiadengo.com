longSummary: "Ellen Hoffman is a longstanding client who runs a high-end jewelry business in Dallas. A few years ago, I built her first website on Wordpress with a WooCommerce plugin. In early 2020, Ellen reached out again for a refresh. She needed to update her branding, but also wanted a more robust online shopping presence. To make it easier for Ellen and her small team to manage the online storefront, I moved her from Wordpress (which was difficult to maintain without my help) to Shopify."
