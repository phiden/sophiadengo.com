longSummary: "In mid-2017, I was a senior UX designer working on Vets.gov (now rolled into VA.gov) with the Digital Service at VA. The team had a very efficient workflow: daily releases to production, a distributed and collaborative development workflow, and a robust research and design team. What it didn't have was a single source of truth for any of the UI elements, either from a visual or a code perspective.

This lack of a canonical reference was causing divergence in the UI, visually, and in the codebase. The visual quirks were such that nobody could really point at Vets.gov and say that it looked wrong, and everything worked well, but the inconsistencies were rapidly building to the point where the growing design team was beginning to struggle to stay in step with one another. From a development standpoint, multiple versions of the same patterns were making it tough to continue rapidly development and steady maintenance of core product features.

In early 2017, with the support of Digital Services at VA's leadership, two engineers and I prototyped the first version of Formation in Fractal. Our proof of concept was as single button"
