longSummary: "One of the projects I'm proudest of is a 2008 multimedia documentary that I helped to produce. Although it's nearly 14 years old, the subject matter is still extremely relevant.

Originally, I wrote the entire site in dynamic Flash with an HTML wrapper, as was common practice in 2008. A few years ago, the lead videographers on the project edited a longer cut of the work and posted it to YouTube, which then allowed for a smaller, static HTML site."
