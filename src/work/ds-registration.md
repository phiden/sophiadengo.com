goal: "Improve DemandStar's supplier registration process."
challenge: ""
plan: ""
summary: "DemandStar's supplier registration process was implemented quickly, and without user testing. It was a several-step process that included selecting a free product, telling us about yourself and your business, and potentially choosing additional products and completing a credit card transaction, all before actually logging on to the platform.

Analytics showed that people were dropping off the registration process without completing it, reducing the number of suppliers on the platform and revenue potential.

Going through the registration process several times myself, I could see places where we could really simplify the workflow and improve the user interface without sacrificing the existing business requirements."
