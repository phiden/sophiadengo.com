longSummary: "When I joined the GSA Fleet team as the UI/UX lead in 2020, I was responsible for bringing design best practices to a largely engineering team that did not know or trust me -- or design processes. In a pre-COVID world, I'd have organized a team meal or casual meeting to promote cohesion. Instead, in order to break the ice, introduce myself, and introduce a tool we'd be required to use on the project, I put together a quick USWDS-based website showcasing my favorite snacks. I then used the site as a demo for the design system's speed and features during a day-long design workshop with my new team. While I don't know if anyone tried the snack recipes, I do know that by the end of that meeting, my colleagues and I had a better sense of each other and a little more trust than we'd had to start."
