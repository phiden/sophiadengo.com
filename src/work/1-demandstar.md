  - title: 'Why start with an existing style guide?'
    summary: "When I joined DemandStar, I inherited a detailed but incomplete styleguide, and a platform that was built quickly and without a lot of attention to consistency in the UI. My overarching responsibility as the sole designer at the company is to ensure that platform is usable, accessible, and as frictionless as possible. A big part of that, which is often overlooked, is visual consistency. But there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Instead of throwing out the existing guide and beginning from scratch, I used the inherited guide as a starting point. The ultimate goal is a Figma-based styleguide full of Figma components that I can use to rapidly prototype, and that my engineering team can use as a canonical visual reference."

  - title: 'Audit the UI'
    summary: "It was pretty clear after spending a day or so with the platform and styleguide that the two had already diverged pretty significantly, so the next step to a more robust guide (which will ultimately become a full-fledged design system) was to understand where the inconsistencies exist in the production interface. Knowing which patterns are used most often, which have diverged most often, and which are causing usability problems helps me know what to prioritize in the styleguide -- and what to ask the engineers to prioritize when they're building new components."

  - title: 'Build the styleguide'
    summary: "This is still, and will likely always be, a work in progress. I began with the components I knew I'd need for my first forays into designing new user flows: buttons and form controls, and moved from there into less frequently used pieces of the UI, like status tags, and new components, like alert boxes. Next up: combining my design assets with the engineering team's Storybook instance, so that we go from styleguide + component library to a functional design system."

  - title: 'What about accessibility?'
    summary: "I came into DemandStar from federal contracting, where accessibility best practices became very near and dear to my heart. It's a personal goal of mine to make DemandStar more and more accessible over time. While I can't yet influence things like screenreader compatibility or even keyboard navigation, every pattern I touch in the styleguide is modified as needed to become more usable. The best example, currently, is the form controls: I changed their layouts to support screenreader expectations and increase readability."
