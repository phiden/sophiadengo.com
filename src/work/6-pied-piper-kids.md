longSummary: "When COVID hit, I was lucky enough to be working a stable, remote, full-time job that enabled me to take on the occasional freelance project. The owner of Pied Piper Kids reached out in the very early days of the pandemic, looking for digital solutions for a brick-and-mortar business.

This was less of a design challenge, because Shopify has really excellent themes available, than it was a project management challenge. Pied Piper's owner knew her online presence was dated and wouldn't readily support e-commerce, but she also didn't know where to start. We also had an extremely short timeline: there was a very real risk that the business would not survive the pandemic if we couldn't get it online quickly.

In addition to setting a project timeline and budget and doing the organizational work Shopify requires, my primary task was reassuring my client that she could, in fact, learn a new platform and successfully bring her business online quickly.

We went from working agreement to a stable, revenue-generating site in three weeks."
