longSummary: "This was just a fun little side project. I needed to apply to a flight scholarship, which had 'the most unusual submission' as its judging criteria. Previous winners had submitted songs and poems and a board game. I've been meaning to design a new flight bag for myself anyway, and so I did, but then was at a loss for how to actually submit the bag to an e-mail address. A quick and dirty static HTML site was the answer. Using the US Web Design System as a framework, I pulled together this site for two audiences: the scholarship panel that needed to see my love for flying and my 'unusual' way of expressing that, and for any bag makers who might want to try making their own."
