summary: "Ad Hoc is a federal contractor that got its start during the healthcare.gov rescue. I was a relatively early addition to its design team, and over the course of four years I worked on contracts for VA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and GSA Fleet while also supporting internal Ad Hoc projects.

Because my roles on each contract varied so widely, they're presented here as individual posts."
