summary: "I provide freelance design and development skills to individuals, small businesses, and agencies.

Lately, I've been supporting a pair of Shopify websites for two women-owned small businesses with very different sets of needs.

Ellen Hoffman is a longstanding client of mine, a jeweler who at the end of 2019 decided to move off the Wordpress e-commerce platform I'd set up in 2015 to Shopify, looking to ease the back-end management of her business, Ellen Hoffman Designs.

When COVID hit, I heard from the owner of Pied Piper Kids, a 50-year-old brick and mortar children's store in Baltimore, MD. Facing the possibility of losing her business when the city shut down, she wanted to replace her decade-old webpage with a Shopify storefront. We were able to launch her store inside three weeks, and it remains online even as her brick-and-mortar has reopened.

One of my longest-running projects is BorderStories, an independently produced documentary series that launched in 2008 and remains online. In 2017, I pulled down the original, Flash-based site I'd built while traveling with the documentary team and replaced it with a much more lightweight site that houses the YouTube cut of the documentary."
