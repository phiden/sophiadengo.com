role: 'Design systems subject-matter expert'
when: 'Aug 2018 - Aug 2019'
summary: "Splitting time between QPP and WDS, I advocated for and supported a pair of design systems at different levels of maturity.

The QPP design system was only an idea when I began work, and I spent a fair amount of time auditing the UI and working with the development and design teams to bridge gaps in understanding and need. By the time I left, we had a prototype system in development.

The WDS design system, on the other hand, was already in active use when I joined the program. The work was to advocate for its use across CMS properties while simultaneously maturing the system itself. As a team of two, we focused on socializing the system to people unfamiliar with design systems as a concept, while also considering best practices for governance, growth, and component deprecation."
