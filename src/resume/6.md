summary: "Working in concert with the Digital Service at VA, I helped to design and validate a variety of forms and services on Vets.gov, including a Discharge Upgrade tool that helped over 100,000 Veterans regain access to their benefits.

I also originated the design system, affectionately known as Formation, working directly with two engineers to get stakeholder buy-in and bring the system into production.

I was ultimately able to use the design system to support the Vets.gov/VA.gov brand consolidation, using it to rapidly code prototypes of the new VA.gov homepage."
