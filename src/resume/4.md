summary: "EQRS -- End-stage Renal Failure Quality Reporting System -- is an effort to modernize the three legacy systems that CMS uses to determine how clinicians are performing, with respect to rendering care to renal patients.

I rolled on to the project mid-stream to provide subject-matter expertise in human-centered design and research practices. As one of three designers, I ultimately led the redesign of a substantial chunk of the EQRS ecosystem: the Quality Incentive Program.

In an effort to standardize the user interface across EQRS, I also advocated for and eventually rebuilt the program's design system, with the intent of leaving it so that it might be picked up easily by another dev or designer."
