summary: "As part of Bloomberg Philanthropies’ What Works Cities initiative, spent 11 months doing on-site city government assessments, determining how cities collect and use civic data. The team would then use that information to build custom plans to help cities use their data to more efficiently reach their municipal goals.

Because of my design and development background, I also handled GovEx’s internal tech projects and provided feedback on external consultants’ design work."
