                <p>EQRS -- End-stage Renal Failure Quality Reporting System -- is an effort to modernize the three legacy systems that CMS uses to determine how clinicians are performing, with respect to rendering care to renal patients.</p>
                <p>I rolled on to the project mid-stream to provide subject-matter expertise in human-centered design and research practices. As one of three designers, I ultimately led the redesign of a substantial chunk of the EQRS ecosystem: the Quality Incentive Program.</p>
                <p>In an effort to standardize the user interface across EQRS, I also advocated for and eventually rebuilt the program's design system, with the intent of leaving it so that it might be picked up easily by another dev or designer.</p>

                <p>Splitting time between QPP and WDS, I advocated for and supported a pair of design systems at different levels of maturity.</p>
                <p>The QPP design system was only an idea when I began work, and I spent a fair amount of time auditing the UI and working with the development and design teams to bridge gaps in understanding and need. By the time I left, we had a prototype system in development.</p>
                <p>The WDS design system, on the other hand, was already in active use when I joined the program. The work was to advocate for its use across CMS properties while simultaneously maturing the system itself. As a team of two, we focused on socializing the system to people unfamiliar with design systems as a concept, while also considering best practices for governance, growth, and component deprecation.</p>

                <p>I also originated the design system, affectionately known as Formation, working directly with two engineers to get stakeholder buy-in and bring the system into production.</p>
                <p>I was ultimately able to use the design system to support the Vets.gov/VA.gov brand consolidation, using it to rapidly code prototypes of the new VA.gov homepage.</p>

            <p>Ellen Hoffman is a longstanding client of mine, a jeweler who at the end of 2019 decided to move off the Wordpress e-commerce platform I'd set up in 2015 to Shopify, looking to ease the back-end management of her business, <a href="http://ellenhoffmandesigns.com/">Ellen Hoffman Designs</a>.</p>
            <p>When COVID hit, I heard from the owner of <a href="https://piedpiperkids.com/">Pied Piper Kids</a>, a 50-year-old brick and mortar children's store in Baltimore, MD. Facing the possibility of losing her business when the city shut down, she wanted to replace her decade-old webpage with a Shopify storefront. We were able to launch her store inside three weeks, and it remains online even as her brick-and-mortar has reopened.</p>
            <p>One of my longest-running projects is <a href="http://borderstories.org/">BorderStories</a>, an independently produced documentary series that launched in 2008 and remains online. In 2017, I pulled down the original, Flash-based site I'd built while traveling with the documentary team and replaced it with a much more lightweight site that houses the YouTube cut of the documentary.</p>
