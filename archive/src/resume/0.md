summary: "Joined Zapier as the first dedicated designer for one of the core parts of the product. I established a tight feedback loop with the front- and back-end engineers on the squad and Zapier's UXR practice, which has enabled us to speed up delivery on new features. I've also served as mentor to a newly-certificated UX designer in her first professional design role, helping her orient to working with user researchers and design systems. Currently working on exploring the product's information architecture and global search capabilities to support increased ease of use as we integrate new products to the Zapier platform."
